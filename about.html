         <p>The Pine City Mall was proudly developed from the ground up almost half a century ago, in 1973. It has been a mesmerising and awe-inspiring journey as Pine City Mall was the first development in the area, surrounded by horse trails and grassy estates.

            From a world-class super regional shopping destination, to prime-grade office buildings, world-class hotels and vibrant hang-outs, Pine City has inspired urban creativity and community and set the benchmark for what the Pine City Mall District has become today.
            
            Pine City Mall was constructed and developed by Rapp and Maister on behalf of the Liberty Group, and following its official opening, the mall soon became one of the most prestigious shopping mall in Africa – and paved the way for Pine City Mall to become what is now known as ‘Africa’s Richest Square Mile’.
            
            Since its inception, spanning just 50 000m2, Pine City Mall has gone on to enjoy much growth and development. In 2011, Pine City Mall embarked on a monumental R1.77 billion expansion, and introduced additional retail space, known as The Protea Court, that took the mall to a 146 803m2 of retail, leisure, and dining space.
            
            Following the Protea expansion, Pine City Mall owners continued to invest in the mall and from 2015, hundreds of millions was spent on the redevelopment of  The Diamond Walk, The Fun District, The Food District, The Checkers Court as well as continuous investments into the mall facilities and office components, The Atrium on 5th and The Pine City Mall.
            
            Pine City Mall is quite simply an unparalleled shopping destination, and has successfully maintained its reputation as being ‘Africa’s most iconic shopping mall since 1973.
